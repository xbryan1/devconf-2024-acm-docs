== Install Advanced Custer Management Operator

We will go through the Advanced Custer Management Operator installation following below steps:

- **Enable master node scheduling**

We are going to enable master nodes for scheduling workloads.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm replace -k 02_bootstrap/base/openshift/base
----

Let's check the results as follows:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm get scheduler cluster -o yaml -o=jsonpath='{.spec.mastersSchedulable}{"\n"}'
----

We are expecting **true** as a  result.

WARNING: This configuration is not recommended for production ;-)

TIP: https://access.redhat.com/articles/2988581[OpenShift Admins Guide to jsonpath]

- **Install Advanced Custer Management Operator**:

Let's install the Advanced Cluster Management Operator.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm apply -k 02_bootstrap/base/acm_operator/base
----

It will create the following resouces:

* `Namespace` - open-cluster-management
* `OperatorGroup` - open-cluster-management-devconf2024
* `Subscription` - Advanced Cluster Management Operator

Wait until all pods are in `Running` status and `Ready`. It can take a couple of minutes approx.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
watch oc --context acm get pod -n open-cluster-management
----

After installing the Advanced Cluster Management Operator, we also need to create the CRD object `MultiClusterHub`. 

- **Create `MultiClusterHub`**:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm apply -k 02_bootstrap/base/acm_multiclusterhub/base
----

Wait until the Advanced Cluster Management Operatator is `Runnig` status, in the meanwhile the status is `Installing`. It can take up to 10 minutes.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,shell, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
watch oc --context acm get mch -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].status.phase}' -n open-cluster-management
----

Once the status change to `Running`, verify all pods are `Running` and `Ready`.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
watch oc --context acm get pod -n open-cluster-management
----

[#console]
== Access to the Advanced Cluster Management Web Console

Advanced Cluster Management Console is integrated with the Openshift Console, so once the Advanced Cluster Management Operator is installed, the Openshift Console will show a new item "All Clusters" on the side navigation menu as below:

- **Access to Advanced Cluster Management Console**:

* Console: https://console-openshift-console.apps.<your_domain>/
* User: kubeadmin
* Password: <your_password>

image::deploy/deploy00.png[]

**All Cluster** will provide you access to the Advanced Cluster Management Console and **local-cluster** will provide you access to the Openshift Cluster.

Also, the Advanced Cluster Management provides a dashboard UI. We can access it through a OpenShift `Route`. List routes in the `open-cluster-management` namespace and get the address of console https://multicloud-console.apps.<your_domain>

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm get route -n open-cluster-management
----

Let's switch to the Advanced Cluster Management Console and Login with Openshift to check that we can access properly.

[#gitops]
== Install GitOps Operator

The next step is the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/cicd/gitops/installing-openshift-gitops.html[OpenShift GitOps Operator] installation. OpenShift GitOps uses https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Argo CD] to manage specific cluster-scoped resources. Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

Let's install it:

- **Setup GitOps Operator**:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm apply -k 02_bootstrap/base/gitops_operator/base/
----

Wait until pods in `openshift-gitops` namespace are in `Running` status and `Ready`. It can takes a up 2 minutes.

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
watch oc --context acm get pods -n openshift-gitops
----

- **Change tracking resources from label to annotation**:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc patch argocd openshift-gitops -n openshift-gitops --type='json' -p='[{"op": "add", "path": "/spec/resourceTrackingMethod", "value": "annotation" }]'
----

- **Access to ArgoCD Console**:

ArgoCD Console is accessible from the Openshift Console

image::deploy/deploy13.png[]

image::deploy/deploy14.png[]

Login into the ArgoCD Console with the Openshift credentials. 

image::deploy/deploy15.png[]

Also, an Openshift `Route` is created:

[#gitopsacm]
== Integrate Openshift GitOps and Advanced Cluster Management

Once we have completed the Advanced Cluster Management and Openshift Gitops Operators installation, we will go through the integration process between them. So, this process will let us:

- Deploy and discover ArgoCD multicluster applications
- Setup Git or Helm Applications based repositories
- Configure sync policies for our applications
- Configure placement based on labels or clustersets

Advanced Cluster Management introduces a new `gitopscluster` resource kind, which connects to a `placement` resource to determine which clusters to import into Argo CD. This integration allows you to expand your fleet, while having Argo CD automatically engage in working with your new clusters. This means if you leverage Argo CD `ApplicationSets`, your application payloads are automatically applied to your new clusters as they are registered by Advanced Cluster Management in your Argo CD instances.

image::deploy/deploy18.png[]

Let's run the following commands to perform the Openshift GitOps Operator integration with Advanced Cluster Management

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm apply -k 02_bootstrap/base/gitops_acm/base/
----

It will create:

* a `ManagedClusterSet` - **devconf2024-gitops-clusters**. `ManagedClusterSet` resources allow the grouping of cluster resources. We will add both Openshift Cluster `local-cluster` and `devconf2024-cluster01` into this `ManagedClusterSet` which enables deployment across all of the Openshift Cluster.

* a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` - **devconf2024-gitops-clusters**. `ManagedClusterSetBinding` resource will bind a `ManagedClusterSet` **devconf2024-gitops-clusters** to a `namespace` **openshift-gitops**. It means that applications and policies that are created in the `openshift-gitops` namespace can only access managed clusters that are included in the bound managed cluster set resource.

* a `Placement` - **rhte2023-gitops-clusters-placement** based on a ManagedCluster label **vendor=Openshift** and claim **platform=AWS**

As a Placement's example:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
---
apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta1
kind: Placement
metadata:
  name: devconf2024-gitops-clusters-placement
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  predicates:
    - requiredClusterSelector:
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            vendor: OpenShift
        claimSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: platform.open-cluster-management.io
              operator: In
              values:
                - AWS
----

We will see more `Placements` examples on the next sections.

TIP: https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.10/html-single/multicluster_engine/index#placement-binding[Placement Examples] to select a cluster wih the largest allocatable memory and/or CPU.

NOTE: When you integrate ACM with the GitOps operator for every managed cluster that is bound to the GitOps namespace through the placement and ManagedClusterSetBinding custom resources, a secret with a token to access the ManagedCluster is created in the namespace. This is required for the GitOps controller to sync resources to the managed cluster. When a user is given administrator access to a GitOps namespace to perform application lifecycle operations, the user also gains access to this secret and admin level to the managed cluster

[#managedcluster]
== Registering local-cluster to GitOps

After the ACM/GitOps integration is done, let's add `local-cluster` to `ClusterSet` **devconf2024-gitops-clusters**. 

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm label ManagedCluster local-cluster cluster.open-cluster-management.io/clusterset=devconf2024-gitops-clusters --overwrite
----

and check that cluster `local-cluster` is added as an ArgoCD Cluster from the **ArgoCD Console > Settings > Clusters** where we expect to see `local-cluster` as one of the clusters

image::deploy/deploy16.png[]

image::deploy/deploy17.png[]

and the `local-cluster` being part of the `ClusterSet devconf2024-gitops-clusters` Cluster Set through `Openshift Console > Advanced Cluster Management > Clusters > Cluster sets`

[#deployall]
== Argo CD â€” App Of Everything

This is the last step of this section where will automate with ArgoCD everything that we were doing so far. Let's change the `ApplicationSet` YAML file according to your settings.

- **Edit the Application yaml file**
 
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
vi 02_bootstrap/argocd/devconf2024-bootstrap-gitops.yaml
----

and change `server` to your cluster `https://api.<your_cluster>:6443` and `repoURL` to your git repository `https://github.com/<your_github_account>/devconf-2024-acm-apps.git` forked previously:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: devconf2024-bootstrap-gitops
  namespace: openshift-gitops
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: openshift-gitops
    server: https://api.<your_cluster>:6443
  project: default
  source:
    path: devconf2024/02_bootstrap/base
    repoURL: https://github.com/<your_github_account>/devconf-2024-acm-apps.git
----

finally, let's create the Application:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc --context acm apply -f 02_bootstrap/argocd/devconf2024-bootstrap-gitops.yaml
----

Let's check the results from the Advaced Cluster Management Console and ArgoCD Console:

**ACM > Applications > Search > bootstrap**
