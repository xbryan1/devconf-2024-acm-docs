== Hands-on Lab Environment

This hands-on lab will be based on two OpenShift clusters. The first one has been already installed, and the second one will be installed from ACM following the steps in this lab. Both Openshift clusters will run on Amazon Web Sservices public cloud:

- Cluster `local-cluster`: It has been already installed. In this cluster you will install ACM/GitOps Operators and deploy applications.

- Cluster `devconf2024-cluster01`: You will install the second Openshift cluster and deploy applications.

- Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management 2.10
- Gitops Operator 1.12

[#occontext]
== Switching context between clusters

In order to easily switch between Openshift clusters in this lab, we will create a new context for the local-cluster. 

- Login into the local-cluster

NOTE: Cluster admin user is **opentlc-mgr** instead of **kubeadmin**.
